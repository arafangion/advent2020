This is my Advent of Code.

I did not stick to a particular language for this one.

They could be significantly more polished as well, I pretty much just did the first thing I thought of, considering the nature of the competition.

Day 1: Swift
Day 2: Python 3
Day 3: Haskell
Day 4: C
Day 5: Ruby
Day 6: C++
Day 7: Perl (With some tips with the language, "mst" offered to refactor part 1)
Day 8: Lua
Day 9: sh (Using the dash shell)
Day 10: Ruby (By mistake, I forgot that I had already used ruby on day 5)
